                        <p class="aboutus-text">MovieTickets.com is an online movie ticketing website founded by AMC Theatres and Hollywood.com in 2000 with National Amusements, CBS Corporation and Famous Players all coming on board prior to launch.[1] It is now a subsidiary of Fandango Media. MovieTickets.com provides movie times for all theaters, and online ticket purchasing for all National Amusements theaters and all Clearview Cinemas, among other smaller chains; such as Mann Theatres in Los Angeles. In 2010, MovieTickets.com sold over 16 million tickets for over 200 exhibitors with 14,000 screens.[2]

                                Providing advance ticketing services to 250 theaters chains, MovieTickets.com represents over 50 percent of the top 100 grossing theaters in North America on any given weekend.[3]
                                
                                In 2004, MovieTickets.com became the exclusive online ticket vendor for Moviefone.com, after having entered in a partnership in 2001 that crosslinked their ticketing offerings.[4] Then, in mid-2005, MovieTickets.com established a ticket distribution relationship with consignment ticket reseller PrintTixUSA, adding 20 movie exhibition companies to its ranks and boosting the total number of screens serviced nationwide to more than 10,000.[5] Since then, however, MovieTickets.com had lost ground, losing sole rights to the AMC chain and Moviefone's telephone arm to rival Fandango.
                                
                                In October 2017, MovieTickets.com was purchased by Fandango Media, giving the company a total of over 40,000 screens worldwide.</p>
                        <p class="aboutus-text">Through its operating subsidiary Cineplex Entertainment LP, Cineplex operates 162 theatres across Canada. The company operates theatres under numerous brands, including Cineplex Cinemas, Cineplex Odeon, SilverCity, Galaxy Cinemas, Cinema City, Famous Players, Scotiabank Theatres and Cineplex VIP Cinemas. Cineplex also owns and operates multiple brands for entertainment (such as UltraAVX, Xscape Entertainment Centre, Player One Amusement Group) and restaurants (such as OutTakes and Poptopia). It is also a joint partner in the Scene loyalty program with Scotiabank.</p>
